# Day Maker
A watchface and alarm that will help you get up by making sure you take a configurable number of steps before it stops buzzing.

The three bars at the top are steps, calories, and elevation gain (floors).

The watchface features configurable heartrate display and the ability to turn off the alarm (but no snooze!). To replace the beloved snooze, there is an option to turn off the alarm if you are actively taking steps - I found it annoying to be walking around and have it still buzz at me.

The two bars at the bottom are active minutes and a battery indicator.

Optionally pulls a random image of the sunrise from [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/) to show while you are waking up!

Optionally floats the fitbit logo across the screen - count them and fall asleep faster!

Optionally change the font / bar colors at night to be easier on the eyes if it accidentally (or intentionally) turns on.
